### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing more information. Please take these steps:

- Make sure you’re using the latest version.
- Check that your bug is indeed a bug and not an error on your end (e.g., using incompatible versions).
- Check for existing bug reports in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/jeffreyHoelzel/LouiesRatings/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Search online (including Stack Overflow) to see if others outside of GitHub have discussed the issue.

**Collect Information About the Bug**:
- Stack trace (if available)
- OS, Platform, and Version
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, etc.
- Steps to reliably reproduce the issue

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> Do not report security-related issues publicly. Instead, email sensitive issues to the project maintainers.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. If you encounter an issue:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/jeffreyHoelzel/LouiesRatings/issues/new).
- Explain the expected and actual behaviors.
- Provide as much context as possible, and describe *reproduction steps* that others can follow.
- Provide the information collected in the previous section.

Once filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue. Bugs that cannot be reproduced will be marked as `needs-repro` and may not be addressed until they are reproducible.
