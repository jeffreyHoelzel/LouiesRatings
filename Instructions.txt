Hey Guys!

I finally did it and it was painful. To start run the command `docker-compose up --build`.
You will see lots of red errors but trust the process. Once it is done you should be able to view the containers from localhost:5000 for backend
and localhost:3000 for frontend. I set up some code to test it out and you should see that the message from the backend is sent to the front end
via an api call. If it works then you did it and now you have a working docker enviroment.
