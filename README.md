## Background
---
### Why Louie's Ratings
---
Rather than using multiple websites to get class information, our idea is to consolidate these into one user-friendly site.
### What Our Product Is
---
Louie's Ratings is an NAU class information aggregator website. A web based tool similar to Rate My Professor that also shows data in a graphical format of the amount of students who received A’s, B’s, failed, withdrawn, etc. from previous semesters reported directly from professors. It also displays anonymous data collected from the end of semester course evaluations under each professor. Shows information on what each course is about, if students (dis)like a course, how difficult it is, etc.

## Features
---
- Allows users to rate and view other's ratings for each professor on different aspects (Overall, likeability, good-lectures, etc)
- Graphical displays of grade distributions for class/professor taken from official NAU reports
