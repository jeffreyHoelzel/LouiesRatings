### **1. Introduction**

Louie’s Ratings is a comprehensive tool designed for NAU Computer Science students to enhance their semesterly scheduling experience. This platform allows students to view and analyze professor reviews from previous semesters, along with visual representations of grade distributions. By providing accurate and readily available resources, Louie’s Ratings empowers students to make informed enrollment decisions.

### **3. Tests**

We utilized `unittest` to develop our automated testing.  

**Test Cases:**  
One example is verifying that the professor's name displays correctly on the professor page.  
- **Test Link:** [Test Professor Page](https://github.com/jeffreyHoelzel/LouiesRatings/blob/main/unittest/test.py)  
- **Class Being Tested:** [ProfessorPage.js](https://github.com/jeffreyHoelzel/LouiesRatings/blob/main/web/src/components/ProfessorPage.js)

### **4. Adopted Technologies**

**Technologies and Justifications:**

- **Docker:** Allows for portable, consistent application deployment through containers.
- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for Python, enabling easy asynchronous routing between the backend and frontend.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic web applications, chosen for its ease of use and familiarity within the team.
- **SQLite (Development):** A self-contained SQL database engine, ideal for local testing without impacting the actual database.
- **PostgreSQL (Production):** A robust relational database system, well-suited for production use on DigitalOcean.

### **5. Learning/Training**

Our team enhanced our skills in the adopted technologies through individual research, collaborative discussions, and knowledge sharing. Team members with prior experience provided insights and assistance to those who had specific questions.

### **6. Deployment**

**Production Site:** [louiesratings.com](http://louiesratings.com)

Our application is hosted on DigitalOcean, running in Docker containers configured via Docker Compose. The architecture includes:
- **Service:** Backend functionality
- **Web:** Frontend interface
- **Test:** Automated unit tests
- **Proxy:** Facilitating internal communication and content delivery via an Apache-based server.

### **7. Licensing**

We chose the MIT license for its simplicity, allowing for commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use while maintaining copyright notices.

### **8. README File**

**LICENSE File:**

### **9. Look & Feel**

The user interface was designed to be intuitive and simple, reflecting NAU's branding through color and design choices. Course information closely mirrors NAU's course catalog, ensuring accessibility for students reviewing course details. The layout of professor pages prioritizes convenience, highlighting ratings for quick recognition.

### **10. Lessons Learned**

Our team realized that mastering new technologies takes more time than initially expected. Implementing learned concepts within the project context can be challenging. Moving forward, we aim to better estimate task durations during planning phases to ensure ample time for implementation and refinement of features.
